%   abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract = {Reducing the energy consumed by space cooling and providing outstanding thermally insulated windows are essential requirements for a smart green building. In this study, a new building design concept for envelope/façade is proposed and demonstrated, providing a solution for thermal management in buildings. This new design for the envelope/façade of buildings comprises two major passive and energy-free technologies, a daytime radiative cooler and a thermochromic smart window. The PDMS-silica-silver daytime passive radiative cooler can provide a cooling effect to the indoor environment without energy input, meanwhile the thermochromic smart window using PNIPAm hydrogel can passively modulate the solar irradiance entering buildings through windows. Hence, the energy needed for indoor heating, cooling and lighting can be reduced significantly. To evaluate the energy-saving performance, model houses are built, one of which is assembled using the proposed building design. The orientation effect on the indoor air temperature of the model houses is investigated. Under intensive solar irradiance, a maximum reduction of 4.8 °C of the indoor air temperature is achieved in the model house constructed using the proposed building design. An energy saving of about 17% of air-conditioning systems in buildings constructed with this new design is expected during daytime operation.}

abstract = {The traditional time reversal is considered a promising approach for non-destructive testing and health monitoring of key region and structure, but it is considerably time consuming. This paper presents a time reversal damage localization method, based on particle swarm optimization algorithm, which is capable of improving the real-time performance of health monitoring in ocean platform. Firstly, the virtual focusing model of time reversal is constructed, and a succinct expression of virtual focusing for sensor pairs is proposed. Then, on the definition of the evaluation index, the PSO based time reversal algorithm is proposed, and the proper coefficients is given. Finally, the finite element simulation and experimental case validate that the proposed method is capable of find the damage location within limit iterative steps. Thus, the proposed method is a hopeful method for online monitoring and damage localization of large sized structure.}
