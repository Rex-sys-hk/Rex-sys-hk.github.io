  abstract={This paper presents a generic trajectory planning method for constrained all-wheel-steering robots. The proposed method is based on the concept of the velocity field, which is a novel representation of the traveling cost in the robot's workspace. The velocity field is defined as a vector field that assigns a velocity vector to each point in the workspace, representing the optimal velocity for the robot to reach that point. The velocity field is computed using a novel iterative method that takes into account the robot's kinematic constraints and the obstacles in the workspace. The trajectory planning problem is then formulated as a path optimization problem, where the goal is to find a path that minimizes the integral of the velocity field along the path. The proposed method is evaluated in simulation and on a real robot, and the results show that it can generate smooth and collision-free trajectories for all-wheel-steering robots in complex environments.},

abstract = {Reducing the energy consumed by space cooling and providing outstanding thermally insulated windows are essential requirements for a smart green building. In this study, a new building design concept for envelope/façade is proposed and demonstrated, providing a solution for thermal management in buildings. This new design for the envelope/façade of buildings comprises two major passive and energy-free technologies, a daytime radiative cooler and a thermochromic smart window. The PDMS-silica-silver daytime passive radiative cooler can provide a cooling effect to the indoor environment without energy input, meanwhile the thermochromic smart window using PNIPAm hydrogel can passively modulate the solar irradiance entering buildings through windows. Hence, the energy needed for indoor heating, cooling and lighting can be reduced significantly. To evaluate the energy-saving performance, model houses are built, one of which is assembled using the proposed building design. The orientation effect on the indoor air temperature of the model houses is investigated. Under intensive solar irradiance, a maximum reduction of 4.8 °C of the indoor air temperature is achieved in the model house constructed using the proposed building design. An energy saving of about 17% of air-conditioning systems in buildings constructed with this new design is expected during daytime operation.}

abstract = {The traditional time reversal is considered a promising approach for non-destructive testing and health monitoring of key region and structure, but it is considerably time consuming. This paper presents a time reversal damage localization method, based on particle swarm optimization algorithm, which is capable of improving the real-time performance of health monitoring in ocean platform. Firstly, the virtual focusing model of time reversal is constructed, and a succinct expression of virtual focusing for sensor pairs is proposed. Then, on the definition of the evaluation index, the PSO based time reversal algorithm is proposed, and the proper coefficients is given. Finally, the finite element simulation and experimental case validate that the proposed method is capable of find the damage location within limit iterative steps. Thus, the proposed method is a hopeful method for online monitoring and damage localization of large sized structure.}
