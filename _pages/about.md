I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Robotics and Automation Systems at the **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology** (HKUST) Under the supervision of [prof. Jun MA](https://personal.hkust-gz.edu.cn/junma/index.html). 

My primary research field is **learning-based planning and control** for autonomous driving. I also have some experience on 3D reconstruction, traditional optimization/sampling based planning methods and CUDA programming in projects. 

As to my educational background, I hold a Master’s degree from the **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology** (HKUST) and a Bachelor’s degree from the **Ocean University of China** (OUC). 

I aim to leverage my expertise in mechanical engineering and artificial intelligence to break the technology boundaries of intelligent systems, introducing technology to the masses.

Served as reviewer for RAL, ICML, IROS, and ICRA.
