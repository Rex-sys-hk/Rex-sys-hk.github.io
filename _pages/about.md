I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Robotics and Automation Systems at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My primary research field is planning and control for autonomous driving. As to my educational background, I hold a Master’s degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and a Bachelor’s degree from the Ocean University of China. In the future, I aim to leverage my expertise in mechanical engineering and artificial intelligence to break the technology boundaries of intelligent systems, introducing the benefit of technology to everyone.

Served as reviewer for RAL, ICML, IROS, and ICRA.
